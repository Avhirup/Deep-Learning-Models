    "## Recurrent Neural Networks:Character RNNs with Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we are not interested in isolated datapoints, but rather datapoints within a context of others. A datapoint may mean something different depending on what's come before it. This can typically be represented as some kind of sequence of datapoints, perhaps the most common of which is a time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most ubiquitous sequences of data where context is especially important is natural language. We have quite a few words in English where the meaning of a word may be totally different depending on it's context. An innocuous example of this is \"bank\": \"I went fishing down by the river bank\" vs \"I deposited some money into the bank\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider that each word is a datapoint, most non-recurrent methods will treat \"bank\" in the first sentence exactly the same as \"bank\" in the second sentence - they are indistinguishable. If you think about it, in isolation they are indistinguishable to us as well - it's the same word!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can only start to discern them when we consider the previous word (or words). So we might want our neural network to consider that \"bank\" in the first sentence is preceded by \"river\" and that in the second sentence \"money\" comes a few words before it. That's basically what RNNs do - they \"remember\" some of the previous context and that influences the output it produces. This \"memory\" (called the network's \"hidden state\") works by retaining some of the previous outputs and combining it with the current input; this recursing (feedback) of the network's output back into itself is where its name comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recursing makes RNNs quite deep, and thus they can be difficult to train. The gradient gets smaller and smaller the deeper it is pushed backwards through the network until it \"vanishes\" (effectively becomes zero), so long-term dependencies are hard to learn. The typical practice is to only extend the RNN back a certain number of time steps so the network is still trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain units, such as the LSTM (long short-term memory) and GRU (gated recurrent unit), have been developed to mitigate some of this vanishing gradient effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walkthrough an example of a character RNN, which is a great approach for learning a character-level language model. A language model is essentially some function which returns a probability over possible words (or in this case, characters), based on what has been seen so far. This function can vary from region to region (e.g. if terms like \"pop\" are used more commonly than \"soda\") or from person to person. You could say that a (good) language model captures the style in which someone writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models often must make the simplifying assumption that only what came immediately (one time step) before matters (this is called the \"Markov assumption\"), but with RNNs we do not need to make such an assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Keras which makes building neural networks extremely easy (this example is an annotated version of Keras's LSTM text generation example).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll do some simple preparation - import the classes we need and load up the text we want to learn from.\n"
